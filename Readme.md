# Ruling Mailinator

Application that connects to an IMAP server, and given some rules, applies some actions.

The supported rules are the ones present/described on [IMAP RFC3501](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501#section-6.4.4).<br>
Currently the only available action is to **forward** the e-mail.

The application is designed to be executed in a cronjob.

## Configuration

There are two files that need be created:
* `confs/configuration.json` - Where the IMAP, SMTP and PSQL connection details are placed. Check the `confs/configuration.json.sample` for an example.
* `confs/rules.json` - Where the rules and actions to be applied are described. Check the `confs/rules.json.sample` for an example.

On the database, you need to create a user, password and database. The schema is generated by the application on its first run.

To start the application, I recommend you start by the *help page*:
```bash
$ python main.py -h
```
